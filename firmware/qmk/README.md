# What firmware to use

The firmware you should use depends on the bootloader your microcontroller uses.

The firmware with `dfu` at the end should be used for microcontrollers such as the Elite-C or Bit C (uses dfu)

The firmware without it should be usable with microcontrollers like the pro-micro (uses catarina)
