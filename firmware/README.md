# Firmware
A QMK branch is currently being merged. In the meantime, I recommend flashing my hex file (found in the `qmk` folder) onto your board. This hex file should then have vial support.

To make any customizations, download vial, sideload the json I have provided in the `via` folder, and get editing!

You can find the firmware source code in this branch in my QMK fork [here](https://github.com/ChrisChrisLoLo/qmk_firmware/tree/banime/keyboards/sporewoh/banime40)
